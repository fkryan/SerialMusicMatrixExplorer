A tone row matrix explorer tool based on the music theory work of Arnold Schoenberg. A composer or other admirer of serial music may enter a set of pitches and this program will generate randomized tone row matrices of all row forms at all pitch levels. Furthermore, the user can select a row form and hear it played with MIDI pitches. Run the program by running the Driver class. Functional, but still a work in progress!

Developed in Java 8 in IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
