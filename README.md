A random tone row matrix generator for serial composers that supports not only classic 12-tone rows but also any number of pitches (looking at you, Stravinsky).
Supports 1-12 pitches because I don't like quarter tones.
GUI to come, right now you can use the main method in the Matrix class to input however many pitches you want and the program will generate an annotated matrix of all row forms.
